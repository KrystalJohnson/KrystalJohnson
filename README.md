Hi my name is Krystal my friends call me Krissy
They suggested that if I wanted to learn what 
computer code is and how to write and read it
that this might be a good sight may be a good
place to begin.Escpesially since computers are 
often times an unknown language to my generation
bc they just weren't relevant when I was growing
up.I must admit browsing through that I am 
completely out of my depth here.That being said
I am open to learning new things.I really need
to know where someone with my level of knowledge 
should begin?Any suggestions would be appreciated
Also I would appreciate it if u could minimize 
the smart ass comments.Thsnks in advance
                                Krissy
